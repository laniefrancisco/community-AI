# Community Memory AI

**A retrieval-based conversational system for preserving community knowledge.**

---

## Overview

Community Memory AI is a lightweight AI project that uses **historical community conversations** to provide context-aware responses to new queries.  
The goal is not to replace human interaction, but to **surface past wisdom** in a responsible, ethical way.

---

## Features

- Converts chat conversations into embeddings for semantic search
- Retrieves the most relevant historical response for a user query
- Lightweight, fully self-contained Python + FastAPI prototype
- Focus on **human-centered AI** and ethical data use

---

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.11+
- [Hugging Face Transformers](https://huggingface.co/) for embeddings
- [FAISS](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss) for vector similarity search
- FastAPI for backend
- Pandas, NumPy for data processing

---

## Project Structure

- `data/` – Sample anonymized conversation data  
- `notebooks/` – Step-by-step notebooks for data cleaning, embeddings, and similarity search  
- `src/` – Backend code and core modules  
- `demo_screenshots/` – Screenshots of the prototype UI
